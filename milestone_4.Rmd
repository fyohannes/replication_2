This is the fourth milestone for my final replication project for Gov 1006.^[Gov 1006: Models, this is an example of a footnote.]

I am now replicating ["What the Demolition of Public Housing Teaches Us about the Impact of Racial Threat on Political Behavior"](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/ajps.12156), by Ryan D. Enos. The central research question of this paper is, dow does the context in which a person lives affect his or her political behavior [@paper]? Professor Enos has provided his replication data [@data].  

Here is an example of a table made using GT:

```{r gt, echo = FALSE}

data.1 <- data.frame(a = sample(10:20, 8, replace = TRUE), b = sample(10:20, 8, replace = TRUE), c = sample(10:20, 8, replace = TRUE)) 

gt(data.1) 

# kable(x = data.1, caption = "A Simple Table", position = "!h")



```


Here is an example of a regression table made using GT Summary:

```{r regression, echo=FALSE}

data2 <- data.frame(a = sample(10:20, 8, replace = TRUE), b = sample(10:20, 8, replace = TRUE), c = sample(10:20, 8, replace = TRUE))

mod.1 <- lm(data2$b ~ data2$a) 

t1 <- tbl_regression(mod.1) 

t1




```
