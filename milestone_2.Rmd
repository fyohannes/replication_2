> Milestone #2. Create a repo with the data for the paper which you are considering. Create an Rmd that does something with that data. (Can be a single R command like summary().) Submit the html generated by that Rmd. It is OK, for now, if you donâ€™t yet have the data for your paper. But you still must submit milestone #2, which requires data. What to do? Easy! Pick a back-up paper, with data available, and submit milestone #2 (and #3 and . . .) using that second-choice paper. As soon as you get data for your main paper, you can switch back. Always include a link to the repo, perhaps in footnote, in any html milestone submission.

## Milestone #2

1. Update

After speaking with Alice, I decided to switch papers. I am now replicating ["What the Demolition of Public Housing Teaches Us about the Impact of Racial Threat on Political Behavior"](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/ajps.12156), by Ryan D. Enos.
