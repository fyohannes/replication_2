The paper that I have chosen to replicate for my final project is ["What the Demolition of Public Housing Teaches Us about the Impact of Racial Threat on Political Behavior"](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/ajps.12156) by [Ryan D. Enos](http://ryandenos.com/). The central research question of this paper is: How does the context in which a person lives affect his or her political behavior? Enos studided the 2000-2004 reconstruction of public housing in Chicago -- a period of time with major demographic shifts from previously racially heterogenios neighborhoods to predominantly white homogenous neighborhoods. He found that upon the removal of African Americans from neighborhoods, the voting turnout of the white voters' remaining dropped by more than 10 percentage points. Additionally, his research suggests that proximity was also related to an increase in voting for conservative candidates. Ultimately, Enos concludes that the context in which a person lives affect his or her political behavior quite considerably.
