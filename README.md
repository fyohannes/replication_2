# Research Paper Replication Project

This repository contains my attempt at replicating a published paper by a respected academic. 

The paper I have selected is by [Ryan D. Enos](http://ryandenos.com/) entitled ["What the Demolition of Public Housing Teaches Us about the Impact of Racial Threat on Political Behavior"](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/ajps.12156). 

Thank you to Professor Enos for providing easily accessible [replication data](http://dvn.iq.harvard.edu/dvn/dv/ajps) through the [Harvard Dataverse](https://dataverse.harvard.edu/).

This project is the final for [Gov 1006](https://www.davidkane.info/files/gov_1006_spring_2020.html), a class that has taught me a seemingly endless amount about data science, R, and life's most pressing questions. 

Consider this my application to the School of Athens.
